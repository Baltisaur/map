title: Shipped&#58; Maps for Antenna Mate
---

Maps for Antenna Mate is an experimental web application for finding and linking to transmitters in your browser. It's built entirely with AngularJS + Jekyll and hosted on S3 + Cloudfront for extra low latency goodness.

I decided to open source the code as a learning tool for new developers. When I started with AngularJS I wish I could have gotten my hands on more real-world code. There are thousands of snippets between blog posts but by themselves they fail to answer questions about how to run your tests; or where files should live; or how do you deploy the damn thing.

I'm also hoping it will boost the sales of Antenna Mate for iOS. Maps gives you a good taste, but if you want it to work blazingly fast offline you're going to need to buy the app. By having distinct applications it allows me to keep the products simple and the scope tight.

AngularJS is an absolute joy to develop with. What Ruby on Rails did for the backend in 2007, AngularJS is doing for the frontend in 2014.
