title: JavaScript Rolling Elements with Prototype and script.aculo.us
---

A recent project at work has provided me with the opportunity to create an animated, rolling list of elements capable of iterating through large collections. The idea was inspired by the rolling table on the [GitHub home page](http://github.com) (You'll need to be logged out to view it).

JavaScript Rolling Elements is a small snippet of JavaScript that features:

* Continuously animated rolling
* No duplicate elements
* Scales with large collections
* Unobtrusive
* Compatible with all modern browsers and IE6

View [an example of it in action](http://tatey.github.com/javascript_rolling_elements/). The project is hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/tatey/javascript_rolling_elements/), after starting life as a [Gist](http://gist.github.com/).
