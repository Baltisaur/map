With the release of Safari 4 back in early June, 




Safari 4 is truly 

* Quick to open and browse
* Minimal
* Behaves like a Mac application ought to
* 



I've been a Firefox user before it was called Firefox. It's extensible, minimal and fast (at least on Windows). Firefox has always felt slower on non-Windows platforms, and doesn't behave entirely like a Mac application ought to.

I'm the type of user to care about details which other users would quickly dismiss as insignificant.

* Toolbar control toggle is not animated
* Drag and drop does not always behave as expected
* Context dialogue is not native to 10.5
* Slow to open
* Extensions typically do not adhere to OS X conventions
