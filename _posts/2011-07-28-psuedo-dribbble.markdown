title: Pseudo Dribbble
---

[Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/) gets designers to share screenshots of their work. Dribble is to design what GitHub is to Code. Screenshots are limited to 400x300 pixels and resizing is discouraged. 120000 pixels is an interesting constraint. The community can see enough to provide constructive feedback and designers are forced to scrutinise their selection of screenshots. Subject and detail is paramount. I love that. 

Contribution is restricted players. Players are people who have been invited to participate. The end result is a collection of inspiring artwork from the best designers. [I'm not good enough](http://dribbble.com/tatejohnson) to be a player, but that doesn't mean I can't pretend. I created a [set on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tatejohnson/sets/72157627104124400/with/5896793262/) titled "Pseudo Dribbble" where I am sharing 400x300 pixel screenshots of my work. Comments are enabled.

Best of all, pseudo dribbling [isn't just for images](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tatejohnson/5941915662/in/set-72157627104124400/).
