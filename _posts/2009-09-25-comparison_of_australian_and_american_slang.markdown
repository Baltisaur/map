title: Comparison of Australian and American slang

Even though english is the de facto language of the United States and Australia, I've always been interested in the subtle differences of slang between other english speaking countries. 

While in the United States, I compiled a list of common phrases which were unknown to me, even with exposure to American media.

| United States | Australia  | Sentence                                 |
|:--------------|:-----------|:-----------------------------------------|
| Sandwich      | Burger     | Extra melted cheese on my *sandwhich*    |
| Grill         | Barbecue   | Throw a steak on the *grill*             |
| Pitcher       | Jug        | I'll have a *pitcher* of beer            |
| The check     | The bill   | Could we have the *check* for the table? |
| To-go         | Take-away  | I'll have one smoothie *to-go*           |
| Single        | One dollar | Do you have a *single*?                  |
