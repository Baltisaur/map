title: Holiday to the United States

Three months ago it was spontaneously suggested that two mates ought to travel overseas. Had the suggestion occurred over IRC, it may have looked like this.

On the 20th of September, Jeff and I will be travelling to the United States for two weeks starting in Los Angeles, California. Using a combination of [Google](http://google.com), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/), [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/), [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/) and [Aardvark](http://vark.com/) we booked hotels, flights and tours.
