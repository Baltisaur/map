I've been lead to believe that customs officers in the US have the right to seize computers and copy their contents. Being that paranoid person that I am, I removed confidential files and directories.

* Dotfiles (.ssh, .bash_history)
* ~/Library/Mail
* ~/Library/Mail\ Downloads
* ~/Library/Application\ Support/Firefox
* Virtual machine disk images
* Code
* OpenVPN config
* Deauthorise iTunes, sign out of iTunes
* Encrypt iPhone backup
