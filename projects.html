  <a href="https://github.com/tatey/conformist">Conformist</a>
  <span>(Ruby)</span>
</h3>
<p>Bend CSVs to your will. Let multiple, different input files conform to a single interface without rewriting your parser each time.</p>
<p>Motivation for this project came from the desire to simplify importing data from various government organisations into Antenna Mate. The data from each government was similar, but had completely different formatting. Some pieces of data needed preprocessing while others simply needed to be concatenated together. I did not want to write a new parser for each new government organisation. Instead, I created <a href="https://github.com/tatey/conformist">Conformist</a> and made it available as a Ruby gem.</p>

  <a href="https://github.com/tatey/simple_mock">SimpleMock</a>
  <span>(Ruby)</span>
</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tatey/simple_mock">SimpleMock</a> is a fast, tiny (81 lines) hybrid mocking library. Mix classical mocking with real objects. There's no monkey patching Object or copying. Real objects are completely untainted. The interface is 100% compatible with MiniTest::Mock so there is nothing new to learn. SimpleMock's one and only dependancy is Ruby 1.9.2 or greater.</p>

  <a href="https://github.com/tatey/translink">Translink</a>
  <span>(Ruby)</span>
</h3>
<p>The TransLink Transit Authority coordinates public transport operations in South-East Queensland (Brisbane, Gold Coast, Logan, Sunshine Coast). Their website has an abundance of data with no easy way for a developer to query it. I wrote a gem called <a href="https://github.com/tatey/translink">Translink</a> that scrapes bus routes, trips, stops and times into a relational database. The schema is a subset of the General Transit Feed Specification. I use this data for <a href="http://nextstop.me">Next Stop</a>.</p>

  <a href="http://zoomabletype.tatey.com/">Zoomable Type</a>
  <span>(jQuery, JavaScript)</span>
</h3>
<p><a href="http://zoomabletype.tatey.com/">Zoomable Type</a> is a jQuery plugin for reading small text on a display from far away. Text is upscaled to the largest size based on its width and the browser's viewport. The project was inspired by the "Show in large type" functionality found in Address Book for Mac OS X.</p>
