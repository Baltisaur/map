<p>Take the guess work out of pointing a TV antenna. Within seconds Antenna Mate will accurately point to the direction of your closest broadcasting site from anywhere in Australia. Antenna Mate is used by professional installers, caraveners and DIYers from city and country areas. It's so easy anyone can use it.</p>
<p>I've written about <a href="{{ base.url }}/2011/01/08/reflecting-on-my-first-iphone-app-antenna-mate/">my reflections on iOS development</a> and <a href="{{ base.url }}/2011/01/09/planning-the-future-of-antenna-mate/">planning the future</a> of Antenna Mate.</p>

<p>Aviary is a Ruby gem that generates a static photo gallery using Twitter. Twitter is a fantastic resource for discovering photos of events as they unfold. Searching using your preferred client means you have to do the filtering. Commentary and relinking drown new and interesting photos. In the days the water rose during the 2011 Brisbane floods I wished there was a way to see all the photos without the noise. Now there is.</p>
