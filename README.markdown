# This is data for my blog

It is automatically generated by [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) into a static site. You can visit the live site at [tatey.com](http://tatey.com).

## Plugins

My blog is being built against an experimental build of Jekyll which provides plugin developers with pre, in and post processing hooks. I've [submitted the patch](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues/issue/214), and hope it will be accepted upstream at a future date. In the mean time, you can find the [experimental build at the Jekylless repository](http://github.com/tatey/jekylless/commits/hooks).
