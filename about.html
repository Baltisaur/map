<h2>About me</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23054854@N06/3109308373/in/set-72157611277509178"><img class="img_left" src="/images/me.jpg" alt="Tate Johnson" /></a>I'm a 22 year old Ruby and Rails developer and university student living in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23054854@N06/3319265306/in/set-72157614423917229/">Brisbane, Australia</a>. I enjoy riding bicycles, motorbikes, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23054854@N06/">taking photos</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23054854@N06/collections/72157611344239429/">travelling</a>.</p>

<p>My love of computers started when the old man showed me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia_(1989_video_game)">Prince of Persia</a> on a 386. I bounced from a gamer interested in PC hardware, to a Linux fantatic who would install a distribution on anything with 1's and 0's before developing a genuine passion for software.</p>

<p>Since February 2008 I've been employed part-time as a Ruby on Rails developer for <a href="http://everydayhero.com.au">Everyday Hero</a>, a service for empowering not for profits with the tools to multiply their fundraising efforts.</p>

<p>I'm studying a <a href="http://www17.griffith.edu.au/cis/p_cat/require.asp?ProgCode=1042&amp;Type=structure">Bachelor of Information Technology</a> full-time at <a href="http://griffith.edu.au">Griffith University</a> where I'm in my second year and loving it.</p>

I'm also on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1119786614">Facebook</a>, but I don't visit very often.</p>
